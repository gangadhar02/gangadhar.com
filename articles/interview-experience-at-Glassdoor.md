## Overview of the Interview Process

My interview took place in November 2023 for a Data Engineering Summer Internship role. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Hiring Manager Interview
The first interview was with Vipul, who later became my manager.

- Focus areas included my past experiences and technical questions related to the role.
- Data modeling questions were posed, with helpful guidance provided throughout the process.

> **Tip:** Clearly articulate your thought process; interviewers value your reasoning more than a flawless answer.

### Technical Interview
This session was conducted by a Senior Data Engineer and emphasized problem-solving capabilities.

- I was required to solve two Leetcode-style questions.
- I was expected to explain my methodology, solutions, and analyze time and space complexity.

> **Tip:** Proactively suggest optimizations to demonstrate analytical thinking.

### SQL Challenge
In this segment, I was provided with sample Glassdoor data and asked to perform SQL queries.

- Tested skills included table joins, aggregation functions, and fundamental SQL operations.

> **Tip:** Emphasize clearly articulating your logic and strategy, particularly when time is limited.

### Final Round
The concluding round covered:

- Compensation and benefits
- Job location and role expectations
- Feedback on my overall interview performance


## Key Highlights from My Experience
