# Reflecting on My Interview Experience at Lucid Motors

After sharing my interview experience with Glassdoor, I received an overwhelming response from those who found it beneficial. Encouraged by this, I decided to share another insightful experience—my journey interviewing with Lucid Motors for their Cloud Engineering Internship in October 2023.

If you’re preparing for technical interviews, particularly in cloud engineering, this guide will provide clarity on what to expect.

## Interview Process Overview

### First Round: Phone Interview (HR Screening)

The initial round was a conversational HR screening focused on assessing my skills, experiences, and motivations for joining Lucid Motors. A significant question discussed was, "Why Lucid?" This stage is also a great opportunity to inquire about subsequent interview phases.

> **Tip:** Thoroughly research Lucid Motors to clearly articulate your motivation for joining their team.

### Second Round: Hiring Manager Interview

This round started with a discussion on my previous projects and quickly moved into an intensive technical discussion related to cloud engineering. I was presented with several hypothetical scenarios, such as:

- "If users report your web application is down, what diagnostic steps would you follow?"
- "In the event of an AWS region-wide outage, how would you ensure data backup and business continuity?"
- "How would you approach optimizing and analyzing high AWS costs?"

> **Tip:** Be proficient in cloud basics, such as load balancing, cloud architecture, core AWS services, troubleshooting, billing, and cost optimization.

### Third Round: Technical Coding Interview

I progressed to the final technical stage, conducted by two senior software engineers from the Cloud Platform team. This session primarily tested problem-solving and coding skills.

- I was tasked with two LeetCode-style problems: an easy-level problem followed by a more complex one, which I couldn't fully complete within the allocated time.
- Unexpectedly, I was also asked questions on front-end concepts. This highlighted that Lucid was seeking a Full Stack Engineer with strong cloud expertise rather than purely a cloud engineer.

> **Tip:** Always communicate your thought process clearly and suggest optimizations, even if you're unable to completely solve the given problems.

## Highlights of My Interview Experience

- **Transparent Process:** Recruiters were approachable and responsive, significantly enhancing my interview experience.
- **Supportive Hiring Manager:** Clear communication regarding internship expectations and the project scope was refreshing and insightful.

I extend my gratitude to Rafael Turino (formerly of Lucid Motors) and Venezia De France for providing me this valuable opportunity.

## Final Thoughts

Although my journey with Lucid Motors concluded at this stage, the experience was profoundly insightful, enhancing my confidence in technical interviews. I look forward to potentially interviewing with Lucid Motors again in the future.
