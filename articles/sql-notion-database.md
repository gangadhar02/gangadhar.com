## Background: From Curiosity to Obsession

Two years ago, during a database migration project at Accenture, I found myself facing SQL challenges far beyond what I'd seen before. What began as a search for "how to perform an outer join" spiraled into a deep fascination with SQL's capabilities.

That was the beginning of a never-ending journey.

## Why a Notion Database?

I needed a system to organize, track, and review every tough SQL problem I encountered. That’s when I started building a fully customizable Notion database focused solely on SQL mastery.

It evolved into a structured, visual learning tool that helps me:
- Track what I’ve solved vs. what’s pending
- Measure my strengths and weaknesses
- Categorize problems by concept, complexity, and platform

## Key Features of My Setup

- **Tags by Topic**: Queries are labeled with relevant concepts such as Joins, Window Functions, Recursive CTEs, Subqueries, etc.
- **Complexity Levels**: Every question is marked as Easy, Medium, or Hard.
- **Expertise Tracker**: I log whether I was able to solve the problem ("Could Solve") or not ("Couldn’t Solve").
- **Progress Indicator**: A checkbox tracks which queries are done vs. those in progress.
- **Calendar Integration**: A built-in calendar view lets me plan my weekly and monthly practice goals.
- **Company-Wise Filter**: Separate views let me target Amazon-style, Facebook-style, or other company-specific patterns.

## Tools & Sources Covered

To ensure a comprehensive practice experience, I’ve pulled problems from multiple platforms:
- LeetCode
- DataLemur
- Interview Query
- YouTube

This blend gives me exposure to both classic and niche SQL problems.

## Next Steps in My SQL Journey

Writing a correct query is only half the challenge. Performance is the true differentiator. Here’s what I’m focusing on now:

- Mastering query execution plans
- Partitioning and clustering data
- Advanced indexing strategies
- Studying the internals of query optimizers
- Learning dimensional modeling (à la Kimball): facts, dimensions, and surrogate keys

## Final Thoughts

This Notion database isn't just a personal project—it's become a reflection of my growth as a data professional.
